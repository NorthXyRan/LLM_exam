A student only earns a point if their answer matches a corresponding scoring point (either fully or semantically).\n\nYour job is to evaluate each student answer strictly based on the standard answer and the grading criteria described below.\nOnly return the JSON output in the specified format—no additional explanations, comments, or summaries.",

    "Correct Answers": "If the student matches a scoring point from the standard answer (either exactly or with equivalent meaning), the response is considered correct.",

    "Unclear Answers": {
      "Type 1": "Partially correct — answers part of the scoring points but omits or incorrectly states others.",
      "Type 2": "Incomplete match to a single scoring point.",
      "Type 3": "Typos in key terms that significantly affect the key scoring point.",
      "Type 4": "Mixed categorization — grouped correct content without proper structure when structure is expected."
